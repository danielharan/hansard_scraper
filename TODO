BUGS:
  interventions:
    formatting gets lost
    links inside also get lost
  time stamps:
    in 2009-03-12 the (1020) mark is missing, probably because it's not inside an intervention

TODO:
  -correlate intervention anchor with member_id
  -correlate votes to scraped members
  -handle written questions
  -extract time marks
  
  -produce output that can be verified by a human
